# learn-syntax
A repository showing different tasks and challenges I try to solve to teach myself proper syntax, with the end goal of becoming more independent from AI when writing code.

Feel free to fork away or create new branches with Katas, tasks or challenges for me to try! All I want to do is learn, and become a more independent developer.
